Data And materials 

1)Four Vector maps of Paris in shapefile format downloaded from CLC database 

2)The file named "arffFileL" corresponds to the learning file. It contains transactions describing life trajectories of Geographic objects (GOs) from Paris and are derived based on vector maps of the city at the dates: 1990, 2000 and 2006 (shp files)

3)The file named "arffFileL" corresponds to the Test file. It contains transactions describing life trajectories of GOs from Paris and are derived based on vector maps of the city at the dates: 2000, 2006 and 2012. The functions identified in the 2012 map are compared to those predicted using the generated rules. 

4)The Rules (Rules.zip) folder contains sub-folders corresponding to the association rules generated by the used algorithms.
In each folder the Rules are stored in an excel file "Rules.xls", prediction rules and stability rules are stored separately in, respectively, the files "ListOfPredRules.xls" and "ListOfStabRules". "reglestraduitesPred.xls" and "reglestraduitesSred" gives the prediction rules and the stability rules in a more comprehensive way (translation of codes according to the CLC Nomenclature described in the image file "Nomenclature.png")
