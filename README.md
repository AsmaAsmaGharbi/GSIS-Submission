The file named "arffFileL" corresponds to the Test file. It contains transactions describing life trajectories of GOs from Paris and are derived based on vector maps of the city at the dates: 2000, 2006 and 2012. 
The functions identified in the 2012 map are compared to those predicted using the generated rules.
